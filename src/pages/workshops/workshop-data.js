      The goal of this course is to give you the knowledge of advanced patterns you can use to make React components
      that are more flexible, simpler, and more fun to build, use, and maintain. You'll start with a simple
      \`<Toggle />\` component which you'll progressively refactor to each of the patterns so you can see the relative
      trade-offs of the patterns and how they can be used together to increase the usefulness of your component while at
      the same time simplifying things for everyone.

      Having built and shipped components using each of these patterns, Kent will help you understand and weigh the
      trade-offs of each of them and you'll come to intuitively know where to apply each pattern in your own components.
      When you're finished with this course, hopefully you'll have a list of actionable things you can do to rework the
      components that you're building to make them more flexible, simpler, and more fun to build, use, and maintain.

      for you and how it goes about solving those problems. You will have a good grasp on what JSX is and how
      it translates to regular JavaScript function calls and objects.

      Each lesson in this course is just a single \`index.html\` file which will help you keep your focus on
      learning React and not distracted by all the tools that make production applications work. The course
      wraps up with a lesson on how to move from these \`index.html\` files to a more production ready development
      environment and even how to deploy your app to a great service like Netlify.

      - Learn how to set up a new project locally and on GitHub for development
      - Learn how to configure npm for publishing the project to the npm registry
      - Learn how to transpile the source with babel
      - Learn how to add unit tests and code coverage
      - Learn how to add CI (with Travis CI) to run tests automatically and report coverage stats to codecov.io
      - Learn how to automate releases with semantic-release
